<h1 class=header><u>Application Description: "WATR"</u></h1>
<p1 class=paragraph>Did you know that more people have access to cell phones today then they do clean water? Lack of access to plumbing and clean water is a global issue that is often ignored. However, this depressing statistic could actually lead us to the answer. My application, which I call “Watr”, will utilize already existing services like UberEats and Doordash to connect people in need with the nearest fresh water that’s available. To explain exactly what I want to build, let me start with the issue itself. </p1>
<h1 class=header><i>The Issue</i></h1>
<p1 class=paragraph>Water crises may seem like a foreign issue. However, the truth is America suffers just as much. Most recently, Flint Michigan suffered from a major water crisis in 2014 that they still haven’t fully recovered from despite major coverage and awareness. Places such as the city of Detroit, Alaska, and Maine all suffer from lack of clean water or proper plumbing. Known as the water access gap, it’s an issue that affects over 2 million Americans. 1.4 million of those Americans don’t have access to crucial indoor plumbing that provides them with immediate access to clean water. Everyone needs water, making the issue incredibly unbiased. It hits Americans in poverty the hardest, with victims ranging from young children to adults. In a world of easy convenience and technological leaps, the idea that some Americans still can’t access clean or running water is as infuriating as it is confusing. The fact that the issue remains unsolved in so many places points to how pressing it truly is. However, there may be hope. 
</p1>
<h1 class=header><i>The solution: "WATR"</i></h1>
<p1 class=paragraph>Thanks to recent technological advancements and the rise of cell phones, this issue may have a solution. The application I’m proposing uses cell phones to connect people in need with clean water, even if they don’t have access to it in their home/area. The application would be an app called “Watr.” This app, which would be available on both apple and android devices, would resemble other popular food delivery apps such as UberEats and Doordash, except with the express goal of connecting people with the clean water they need. Although many people in poverty don’t often have access to clean water or adequate transportation such as a car, they do have access to cellphones. This utility application would have an easy to use interface, with the ability to put in your location and view a map of your immediate area. The map would include information on the nearest clean water sources. From there, paid delivery drivers would bring water to the area. You would be able to select the amount of water you need, and would have options for different types of water containers (bottles, jugs, etc.) These would be the main and most important components. 

To make this application a reality, we would need a team versatile in both Javascript and Swift. That’s because the application would be available on both iOS and Android platforms to make sure it is accessible from as many smartphones as possible. We would also need a team of graphic designers to make the app visually appealing and cohesive. A separate marketing team would handle getting the word out and connecting the service to people who need it most. There are government programs in place helping fight this crisis already, so hopefully they can pair with the app to further both goals. Government partnership could potentially lower the cost or even make the water free to people who need it. The most crucial part to the success of this application are the drivers. They would be hired and paid to retrieve and deliver the clean water. Luckily, many delivery drivers already juggle multiple delivery apps at once to maximize their pay. “Watr” could be another app they add on to their route.
As I mentioned before, the audience for this app is broad because the issue does not discriminate. People of all ethnicities and ages are in need of water and through this app they could hopefully get them. The app has the potential to go global, just like the water crisis issue. Although it could start with a focus on Americans in need, it would be easily expanded to other countries in need such as Chad or Somalia. For Watr, the sky is the limit.

<h1 class=header><i>Conclusion</i></h1>
<p1 class=paragraph>In conclusion, this is a huge issue that affects far too many people around the globe. When I discovered more people had access to cellphones than clean water, I was disgusted. However, I soon realized that just might be the answer. We can utilize quickly advancing cell phone and app technologies to speed up the process of other more complicated issues like access to clean water. For many people in poverty without plumbing or clean water, the answer just might be in their pocket. </p1>
